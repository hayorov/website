## 📢 Public Speaking

I speak regularly at international conferences and industry panels on cloud infrastructure, platform engineering, AI adoption, and DevOps leadership. Recent engagements include keynotes and panels at Tech Week Shanghai, HashiDays Singapore, Cloud Expo Asia, F5 AppWorld, and DevOps Summit Singapore.

## 🧩 Beyond Work

Engineer at heart — I maintain open-source projects like [helm-gcs](https://github.com/hayorov/helm-gcs) (Helm chart repositories on GCP, Helm 4 compatible) and stay close to the tools I advocate for.

Outside of work, I ride road bikes across Singapore and beyond, build FPV drones, and collect laptop stickers — see my [devlids](https://devlids.com/lids/hayorov).
