## ðŸ“¢ Public Speaking

As an active participant in technical conferences, I enjoy public speaking to share knowledge and insights, stay updated with the latest technologies, and expand my network. I believe in the power of communication and strive to contribute to the tech community through meaningful dialogues.

## ðŸ§© Hobbies and Interests

I am an engineer at heart. I enjoy reading popular science literature and actively contribute to open-source projects such as the [helm-gcs project](https://github.com/hayorov/helm-gcs). I am continuously honing my public speaking skills, which I see as essential for effective leadership and collaboration.

In my leisure time, I am an avid road bike rider, exploring the great outdoors and staying fit. I also have a passion for laptop stickers, showcasing my interests and affiliations through my collection. Check out some of my favorites at [devlids.com](https://devlids.com/lids/hayorov).
