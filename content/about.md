+++

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seasoned professional with 10 years of experience in technical leadership and project management roles - responsible for designing, architecting and leading the development of large and mid-scale distributed systems in classic software (virtualization), cloud supply channel distribution (marketplace) and decentralized digital ledger.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my career, I've been driving projects from ideas and proofs-of-concept to real-world solutions and platforms while mentoring both junior and senior engineers so that together we could implement world-class solutions like [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/), [Parallels Business Automation](http://download.parallels.com/summit/emea2009/presentations/Parallels_Automation_Portfolio.pdf), [Ingram Micro CloudBlue Connect](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/664964/ingram-cloudblue-offers-connect-standalone-product/) and [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com).
