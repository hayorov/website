+++

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a seasoned professional with 10 years of experience in technical leadership and project management roles - responsible for designing, architecting and leading the development of large and mid-scale distributed systems in classic software (virtualization), cloud supply channel distribution and decentralized digital ledger.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my career, I've been driving projects from ideas and proofs-of-concept to real-world solutions and platforms, while mentoring both junior and senior engineers so that together we could implement world-class infrastructure stacks: including build and CI/CD pipelines, resource management, networking, request routing, service discovery, load balancing and more.
