## üë§ About Me

A seasoned software development leader with over 10 years of experience in technical leadership and designing large-scale distributed systems. Specializing in virtualization, cloud supply channel distribution, and blockchain technology, I've successfully delivered infrastructural solutions for industry leaders such as [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/), [Parallels Business Automation](http://download.parallels.com/summit/emea2009/presentations/Parallels_Automation_Portfolio.pdf), [Ingram Micro CloudBlue Connect](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/664964/ingram-cloudblue-offers-connect-standalone-product/), and [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com).

I'm proficient in converting business requirements into robust, scalable software solutions, and I have a strong knack for working with both greenfield projects and legacy systems. With a focus on cloud-native and SRE/DevOps methodologies, I've developed an expertise in distributed systems. I give high priority to toil elimination, and my technology stack includes Python (Flask/Django/Postgres), Go, Kubeflow, and MongoDB. I'm well-versed in Kubernetes, GCP/Azure, HashiCorp Terraform, and have a deep understanding of advanced Prometheus/Grafana usage.
