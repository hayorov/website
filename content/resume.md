&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seasoned software development professional with over 10 years of experience in technical leadership and designing large-scale distributed systems. My expertise includes implementing virtualization, cloud supply channel distribution, and decentralized digital ledger projects for companies such as [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/), [Parallels Business Automation](http://download.parallels.com/summit/emea2009/presentations/Parallels_Automation_Portfolio.pdf), [Ingram Micro CloudBlue Connect](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/664964/ingram-cloudblue-offers-connect-standalone-product/), and [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com). My focus on infrastructure and automation has led to a proven track record of delivering exceptional results.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I specialize in transforming business requirements into software solutions from scratch, and I am equally comfortable working with legacy systems. My expertise lies heavily in distributed systems, with a focus on cloud-native and SRE/DevOps methodologies. I prioritize toil elimination, and my technology stack includes Python (Flask/Django/Postgres), Go, Kubeflow, and MongoDB. I have a particular affinity for Kubernetes, GCP/Azure, HashiCorp Terraform, and advanced Prometheus/Grafana usage
