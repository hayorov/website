Cycling is my main way to explore new places, clear my head, and stay consistent with fitness. I ride mostly on the road with a focus on long steady efforts, scenic routes, and occasional tempo blocks when I am training for an event. The bike is also my preferred way to discover Singapore and nearby regions on trips.

### Why I Ride

- Steady endurance: longer rides at a sustainable pace.
- Simple joy: coffee stops and a good view are non-negotiable.

### Typical Ride Profile

- Distance: 60-120 km for weekend rides, 30-50 km on weekdays.
- Terrain: mostly rolling, with climbs when traveling.
- Time of day: early mornings to avoid heat and traffic.
- Extras: one cafe stop, photos.
