As someone who spends the majority of their time sitting at a desk, often with a laptop or during teleconferences, having a reliable and ergonomic chair is essential. Recently, I upgraded my desk to be adjustable, allowing me to alternate between sitting and standing. But that's a topic for another blog post.

## The Chair Journey

Over the years, I've tested many chairs, but my favorite, after six years, is the [Herman Miller](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_eur/products/seating/office-chairs/) Mirra 1. It's worth noting that the Mirra 1 is an older model in the Mirra series and has been discontinued. At my office in Prudential, we have a variety of Herman Miller chairs, including the Mirra 2 and Aeron. Both are excellent chairs, and even buying them brand new with all the features (often called "fully loaded" with various adjustments and supports) is worth the investment. However, there's something unique and charming about the Mirra 1 that I absolutely love, especially its design and the back of the chair.

## Durability and Longevity

One of the key aspects of the Mirra 1 is its durability. My Mirra 1 was produced around 2012, making it over 10 years old as of 2024. Despite its age, it remains solid and fresh. I did have to replace the mesh seat pad due to an incident where a pen was dropped on it, creating a small hole that eventually grew, rendering the chair unusable for its main purpose.

I contacted the local dealer for a replacement, but the process was cumbersome. Eventually, I found an original Mirra 1 mesh on eBay. Although the shipping from Nebraska to Singapore was costly, it was worth every penny to keep my beloved chair in good condition.

In summary, the Herman Miller Mirra 1 is more than just a chair; it's a testament to good design and durability. Despite being an older, discontinued model, it continues to provide unparalleled comfort and support. If you ever come across one, I highly recommend giving it a try. It's an investment that truly pays off in the long run.
