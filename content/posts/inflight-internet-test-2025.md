> 💰 Plan: Starter Tier – ¥159 RMB (~29 SGD / 21 USD)

In June 2025, I flew from Shanghai to Singapore with China Southern Airlines and tried their **in-flight Wi-Fi**. I opted for the _Starter Tier_, which promises internet access for the full flight at a flat rate of **¥159 RMB** (~29 SGD / 21 USD).

Despite my skepticism, the service was **stable throughout** the entire flight—surprisingly usable for productivity tasks that don’t rely on video or real-time collaboration.
