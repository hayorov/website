I’m an FPV drone DIY enthusiast—I love designing, building, and tuning drones from scratch. While I’m still a rookie UAV pilot, what I enjoy most is the engineering side: bulk sourcing components, optimizing performance, and using my technical skills to bring it all together. Flying is just a bonus that makes the hobby even more rewarding in my spare time.

I’m focused on DIY FPV builds in the 3.5" to 5" range. As an electronics engineer, I spend more time on engineering, assembly, configuration, and tuning than flight practice.

This wallboard is my January 2026 setup: a pair of AOS 3.5" drones with DJI O3 air units, plus a DJI Mini Pro 4 as a fun footage drone I bought recently. I started right away with digital and never really flew analog, moving from Caddx Walksnail to DJI and now mostly using the O3 system.
