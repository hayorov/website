I’m an FPV drone DIY enthusiast—I love designing, building, and tuning drones from scratch. While I’m still a rookie UAV pilot, what I enjoy most is the engineering side: bulk sourcing components, optimizing performance, and using my technical skills to bring it all together. Flying is just a bonus that makes the hobby even more rewarding in my spare time.
